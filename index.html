    of the time queries take to complete or views/partials take to render. In development

    a couple of times to see if there is improvement.

  # processor cores available / avg load time (s/page) * 60 (s/min)<br/>
  =><br/>
  <h2>max throughput in pages per minute</h2>
  
  <!-- 
    It's not likely the code running once will be a problem for the CPU by itself,
    but with a lot of requests happening at a time, it could be. That's where we 
    need to consider the max throughput of our system.
    
    So say you have 4 cores and an average page load time of 1 second. Then you'll max 
    out at around 240 requests per minute.
    
    It'll probably be a little less, because other stuff has to have a little time to run, but
    you know that's the theoretical best on average you can do.
    
    If you're getting close to that, you can either add more CPUs (and RAM, if you're using 
    multiple processes instead of threading), or need to figure out where you can trim
    your response times.

      The most interesting things in the example to me are:
      
      1. The daily hit rate averaged by hour, because if you know the max throughput and it's close to that per hour, you can see where you might need to dynamically scale up.
      2. The reported actions by sum of processing time, because even if it's already a fast action, if you're near max throughput if you can shave that time down, it's like gaining extra processors.

    You can view info about the app server performance and end user performance in the browser.
    
    Paid levels offer more stuff, including more details and historical performance.
    
    It starts off as sorted by most time consuming: not by slowest average. That was the same in 
    request-log-analyzer.
    
    For a while I thought it was silly - why would I care where the most time is spent? 
    
    Well, because that's where you get big wins in performance: if a highly used action can 
    be optimized, that's less time other actions have to wait before getting CPU time. 
    
    And that's especially important when you're nearing your max throughput. In one of the 
    projects recently, we took an already fast action which was used a ton down from averaging 500ms 
    to about 250ms with a small change - it cost less than $100 to make the change, and it meant they 
    didn't need to double their server costs just to get more processors.
